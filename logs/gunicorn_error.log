- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after

- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.

- Rejected
- Not Required

Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.

Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.

- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.

- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Job Card
Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Job Card
Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Job Card
Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.

Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.

Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.

Job Card
Customer Approval/Request
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM)
Customer Approval Process In Job Card (BU: TMCV, Roles: DSvM):
- Currently there is no such provision available to capture customer approval status, sent & received date/time on additional jobs.
- As per the new functionality, we have introduced new fields in Job card for capturing customer approval process on additional jobs.
  - Customer Approval Required
- Customer Approval Sent Date/Time
- Customer Approval Receive Date/Time
- Job Card TAT
- Customer Approval TAT
- Actual TAT
 - Customer Approval Required field will be a Picklist field which will have the below values:
  - Requested
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Not Required
 - Customer Approval Sent Date/Time always should be greater than "Job card created date/time" and it should be less than or equal to System date/time AND it should be less than equal to Customer
Approval received date/time.
- Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time field will become a mandatory filed when the Customer Approval Required status is "Approved" and it should be greater than "Customer Approval Sent
Date/Time" and should be less than or equal to System Time.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" or "Not Required" then "Customer Approval Sent Date/Time" and "Customer Approval Receive Date/ Time" fields automatically will remove the
data & it will be blank/empty.
- If the Customer Approval Required status is "Rejected" then "Customer Approval Received Date/Time" is not required & this filed will be read only.
- "Customer Approval TAT" will have a read only field. When the "Customer Approval Required" is "Approved" then only it will show calculation based on (Customer Approval Received Date/Time –
Customer Approval Sent Date/Time) else Zero in HH:MM format after the job card is closed. 
- "Job Card TAT" will have a read only field and will show calculation based on (Closed Date Time- rectified as Initial Job Card Closure Date & time – Job Card Created Date/Time) in HH:MM format after
the job card is closed.
- "Actual TAT" will have a read only field and will show (Job Card TAT - Customer Approval TAT) in HH:MM format after the job card is closed.
- System check is available on jobs entry complete flag. When user click on it, system will validate the mandatory fields to proceed further only when the "Customer Approval required" is - "Approved", "Rejected" or "Not Required", else it should throw error message: “Please update customer approval status”.
- All above fields will become a read only on first attempt of job closure which is based on Initial Job Card Closure Date & time. Post that, no modification will be allowed even if the same job card is re-opened again for any reasons.
